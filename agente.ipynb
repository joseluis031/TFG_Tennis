    "\n",
    "1. Section: SERVE and RETURN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you must consider the following variables:\n",
    "- **SERVE**: 3W, SvImpact, 1stUnret, D Wide%, A Wide%, 2ndAgg\n",
    "- **RETURN**: 1st: RiP%, RiP W%.1_x, RetWnr%.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to:\n",
    "- Build a detailed **serve-return profile** for each player based exclusively on these 9 variables.\n",
    "- Clearly compare both players for each individual metric.\n",
    "- Then, provide **precise tactical recommendations** for each player on how to exploit their strengths and counter the opponent's strengths in serve and return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important:\n",
    "- You must reference and use **every single variable** in this section. Do not skip or ignore any.\n",
    "- Refrain from vague or general advice. All recommendations must be grounded in the numerical values and logical comparisons.\n",
    "- A player may be weaker on serve but stronger on return — in that case, explicitly state it and recommend focusing on return games to reduce the opponent’s service advantage.\n",
    "- If one player has both better serve and better return stats, explain how they should control that phase of the match and how the opponent can still create disruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critical rule on superiority:\n",
    "- You can only say that a player is **superior** in a variable if the absolute difference in values is greater than **0.8 units**.\n",
    "- If the difference is **0.8 or less**, explicitly state that the values are similar and do not claim superiority.\n",
    "- Do not make recommendations based on small differences (≤ 0.8).\n",
    "- Always justify why one player has an edge — or why neither does — before suggesting any strategic action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your analysis and tactical recommendations as if you were briefing two professional coaches before a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important:\n",
    "When writing recommendations for each player, you must not treat each variable in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must analyze how the variables from both players interact with each other, especially in cases where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One player has a weakness (e.g., low 2ndAgg or low SvImpact), and the opponent has a strength that directly threatens it (e.g., high RetWnr%.2).\n",
    "- One player is aggressive on 2nd serve (high 2ndAgg), and the opponent is vulnerable on 2nd serve return.\n",
    "- A player is very successful in winning return points with winners (RetWnr%.2), and the opponent has a weaker second serve.\n",
    "- A player struggles to return (low 1st: RiP%), and the opponent has a high 1stUnret.\n",
    "\n",
    "These **complementary or conflicting patterns must be linked together** in the recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each recommendation should take into account **both players' stats together**, not just one player's metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Do NOT write recommendations like \"Zverev has a strong 2ndAgg, so he should continue being aggressive.\"\n",
    "✅ INSTEAD: say \"Zverev's high 2ndAgg (14.5) will be effective especially against Rublev, who is weaker at punishing 2nd serves (low RetWnr%.2 = 7.3%).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirement:\n",
    "For each section (Serve, Return), follow this structured approach:\n",
    "1. Examine the numerical values for each metric from both players side by side.\n",
    "Important: Do not proceed to the analysis unless you have first identified which player has the higher and lower value for each metric.\n",
    "2. Clearly and explicitly state which player has the higher value and which has the lower value for every metric. Avoid vague language.\n",
    "3. Base all evaluations of strengths and weaknesses strictly on these numerical comparisons. Do not rely on assumptions or prior knowledge of the players.\n",
    "4. After identifying who leads each metric, explain how that difference might affect gameplay (e.g., consistency, aggressiveness, risk).\n",
    "5. Double-check your logic: ensure that your interpretation (e.g., \"Player A is stronger at serving\") is consistent with the actual numbers shown.\n",
    "6. You are only allowed to say that one player is superior in a given variable if the difference between their values is **greater than 0.8 units** (absolute value).\n",
    "7. If the difference is **0.8 or less**, you must explicitly state that the values are very close and avoid suggesting one player is better in that metric.\n",
    "8. You must not base any recommendation on a metric where the difference is 0.8 or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: Precision is critical. Avoid contradictions such as stating that a player has a higher value when the number is actually lower.\n",
