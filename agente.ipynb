    "4. When a player has a higher RetWnr%.2, suggest attacking second serves early.\n",
    "5. If one player wins more 10+ rallies, recommend that player extend the points. If the other wins more 1–3 shot rallies, recommend shortening the exchanges.\n",

    "Requirement:\n",

    "1. Examine the numerical values for each metric from both players side by side.\n",
    "Important: Do not proceed to the analysis unless you have first identified which player has the higher and lower value for each metric.\n",
    "2. Clearly and explicitly state which player has the higher value and which has the lower value for every metric. Avoid vague language.\n",
    "3. Base all evaluations of strengths and weaknesses strictly on these numerical comparisons. Do not rely on assumptions or prior knowledge of the players.\n",
    "4. After identifying who leads each metric, explain how that difference might affect gameplay (e.g., consistency, aggressiveness, risk).\n",

    "- JannikSinner's higher net point win percentage suggests he should look to approach the net more frequently to finish points efficiently.\n",
